# Fuji Workstation Usage Guidelines
## 1. Initial Setup and Login
1. **Accounts:** All lab users should use their Pitt IDs to access the workstation.
2. **Remote Access:** To connect remotely, use Microsoft Remote Desktop while connected to Pitt’s VPN via GlobalProtect.
- PC name: fuji.csb.pitt.edu
- User account: pitt \ (your Pitt ID)
3. **Locking the Session:** When you are not interacting  with the workstation but running background tasks, lock your session to keep the system accessible to others. Windows > Your account > Lock


## 2. Usage Calendar
1. **Scheduling:** Mark your usage times on the shared calendar. This ensures everyone has fair access and prevents scheduling conflicts. Check the calendar before reserving or starting intensive jobs. Contact Dr. Ishihara to obtain calendar permissions.
## 3. Running Tasks and Background Processes
1. **Restarting:** Before restarting the workstation, confirm with other users to avoid interrupting ongoing processes. 
## 4. Storage and Drive Management
1. **Disk Space:** Avoid filling up the drives, particularly the C: drive. When using cloud storage (e.g., OneDrive), consider downloading files only on demand to prevent local storage from filling up. For instructions on setting up OneDrive to download files on demand, visit [OneDrive Files On-Demand Setup](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-onedrive-files-on-demand-in-windows-0e6860d3-d9f3-4971-b321-7092438fb38e).
2. **File Management:** Regularly delete unnecessary files after your work sessions to maintain adequate space for all users.
## 5. General Etiquette and Best Practices
1. **Resource Usage:** Be mindful of the workstation’s resources (CPU, memory) and try to avoid overloading the system during high-demand periods.
2. **Security:** Do not share login credentials, and always log out completely if you have finished your session for the day.
3. **Communication:** If you encounter issues that might impact others (e.g., potential software conflicts or storage limitations), communicate with the group promptly.
## 6. Maintenance and Updates
1. **Software and System Updates:** Coordinate with Dr. Ishihara before installing or updating softwares on the workstation as changes can impact other users’ workflows. Contact Dr. Ishihara for admin credentials and confirm the installation with him.
2. **Backup and Data Security:** For projects requiring extended use or large datasets, ensure backups are in place and save critical files regularly.
