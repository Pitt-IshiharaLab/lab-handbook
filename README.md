# Ishihara Lab Handbook

<!-- Table of Contents will be auto-generated here -->

# 1. Welcome
You've recently joined the Ishihara lab in the University of Pittsburgh’s Department of Computational and Systems Biology.
We're excited to have you as part of the team!
We hope that you'll learn a lot about stem cells, tissue engineering, biological physics, microscopy, and computational biology, develop new skills (wet lab, data analysis, writing, presenting), make new colleagues and friends, and enjoy the whole process.

This lab manual was inspired by many others (including [Aly lab](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual),  [Lowe-Power lab](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/lab_handbook). It is meant to be continuously updated with input from lab members and others. If you have ideas on contents to add, items to clarify, please talk to me (Keisuke, PI).

If you’re a PI or a trainee in a different lab and want to write your own lab handbook, feel free to take inspiration from this one (and cite us!).
