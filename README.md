# Ishihara Lab Handbook

<!-- Table of Contents will be auto-generated here -->

# 1. Welcome
You've recently joined the Ishihara lab in the University of Pittsburgh’s Department of Computational and Systems Biology.
We're excited to have you as part of the team!
We hope that you'll learn a lot about stem cells, tissue engineering, biological physics, microscopy, and computational biology, develop new skills (wet lab, data analysis, writing, presenting), make new colleagues and friends, and enjoy the whole process.

This handbook was inspired by many others including [Aly](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual),  [Lowe-Power](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/lab_handbook) labs. It is meant to be continuously updated with input from lab members and others. If you have ideas on contents to add, items to clarify, please talk to me (Keisuke, PI).

# 2. Vision, Mission, and Values

### **Vision:**
The Ishihara lab envisions to engineer multicellular tissues as living, programmable materials.
Engineered tissues with physiological and synthetic functions will act as new platforms that advance human health.

### **Mission:**
Our group takes a synthetic approach to multicellular tissue biology. “Synthetic” embodies the experimental creation of states of physical organization and gene expression that push a multicellular system to all possible extremes.
The synthetic approach allows us to discover novel regulatory molecules, dormant genetic programs, and general physical principles, which we will critically evaluate as next generation strategies for organ engineering.
We will quantitatively capture tissue morphogenesis through imaging, computation, and molecular profiling.
Using this knowledge, we will develop genetic, chemical, and physical tools to engineer form and function of *in vitro* tissues such as human brain and cardiac organoids.

### **Values:**
Our core values are curiosity, teamwork, respect, and innovation.
We are committed to creating a diverse team that is inclusive to all cultural and racial backgrounds.

# 4. Communication and Laboratory Etiquette

**Open communication** is the key for every aspect of lab activities!

We thrive on transparently sharing ideas, findings, and concerns among lab members, fostering an environment where everyone feels comfortable expressing their thoughts and collaborating effectively to achieve common research goals.

Our main mode of digital communication is Slack and email. Slack is good for speed, while email is preferred for longer text and archiving purposes. 
Only members can post to the group's mailing list.

### In-person work hours and vacation/absences

We expect you to spend a minimum of 50% of your non-class time physically in the lab. We need spontaneous, in-person communication.

We will not impose core time. If you'd like to designate a certain day of the week for home office, please share this in the schedule tab in [LabMembersInfo](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gm7NiiYUaOu9xGvc94AHQDnNEBrtlLbd7ZU5bwCZrD8/edit?usp=sharing). Update your class schedule every semester.

Mark your vacation/absence days on the lab calendar. If you plan to be be away for more than a week, let Keisuke know by email. 

### Emergencies and asking for help

We understand that unexpected emergencies arise and you cannot work as you had planned. In such cases, please let Keisuke know (no need to share the details, if you feel uncomfortable). If necessary, reach out for help to your fellow lab members to cover during your absence, but take into account that each person has their own work and family duties.
